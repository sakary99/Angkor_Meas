<p>There were once 2 brothers who lived on the 80th level.<br />On coming home one day, they realized to their dismay that the lifts were<br />not working and that they had to climb the stairs home.<br />After struggling to the 20th level, panting and tired, they decided to<br />abandon their bags and come back for them.<br />They left their bags there and climbed on.<br />When they struggled to the 40th level, the younger brother started to<br />grumble and both of them began to quarrel.<br />They continued to climb the flights of steps, quarrelling all the way to<br />the 60th floor.<br />They then realized that they had only 20 levels more to climb and decided<br />to stop quarrelling and continue climbing in peace.<br />They silently climbed on and reached their home at long last.<br />Each stood calmly before the door and waited for the other to open the<br />door.<br />And they realized that the key was in their bags which were left on the<br />20th floor ......<br />[not meant to be a joke at all...if you find yourself laughing at it, it's<br />about time u start thinking about what you want in life.]<br /><br />This story is a reflection on our lives...<br />Many of us live for the expectations of our parents, teachers and friends<br />when we were young.<br />We seldom get to do the things that we really like or love.<br />It is under so much pressure and stress that by our early 20s, we get tired<br />and decide to dump this load.... and enjoy life.<br />Being free of the stress and pressure, we work enthusiastically and dream<br />ambitious dreams.<br />But by the time we ! reach our 40s, we start to lose our vision and along<br />with that, our dreams and goal in life.<br />We began to feel unsatisfied and start to complain and criticize.<br />We live life in misery as we are never satisfied.<br />Reaching 60, we realize that we have little time left for complaining and<br />we began to walk the final episode in peace and calmness.<br />We think that there is nothing left that could disappoint us, only to<br />realize that we cannot rest in peace because we have an unfulfilled<br />dream...<br /><br />A dream we abandoned about 60 plus years ago....<br />So what is your dream? ... Keep them alive...<br />Follow your dreams so that you will not live with regrets....<br />And you will have stories to share with your loved ones.</p>
