<p>A well known speaker started off his seminar by holding up a $20 bill. In the room of 200, he asked, "Who would like this $20 bill?"</p>
<p>Hands started going up.</p>
<p>He said, "I am going to give this $20 to one of you but first, let me do this." He proceeded to crumple the dollar bill up.</p>
<p>He then asked, "Who still wants it?"</p>
<p>Still the hands were up in the air.</p>
<p>"Well," he replied, "What if I do this?" And he dropped it on the ground and started to grind it into the floor with his shoe.</p>
<p>He picked it up, now all crumpled and dirty. "Now who still wants it?" Still the hands went into the air.</p>
<p>"My friends, you have all learned a very valuable lesson. No matter what I did to the money, you still wanted it because it did not decrease in value. It was still worth $20.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Moral: &ldquo;Never ever think that you are not worth anything. Your value must be there! Believe in yourself with humanity.&rdquo;</p>
