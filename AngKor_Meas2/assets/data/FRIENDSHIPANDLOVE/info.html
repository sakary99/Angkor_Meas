<ul>
<li>Love starts with a smile, grows with a kiss, and ends with a tear.</li>
<li>Don't cry over anyone who won't cry over you.</li>
<li>Good friends are hard to find, harder to leave, and impossible to forget.</li>
<li>You can only go as far as you push.</li>
<li>Actions speak louder than words.</li>
<li>The hardest thing to do is watch the one you love, love somebody else.</li>
<li>Don't let the past hold you back; you're missing the good stuff.</li>
<li>Life's short. If you don't look around once in a while, you might miss it.</li>
<li>A best friend is like a four leaf clover: hard to find and lucky to have.</li>
<li>If you think that the world means nothing, think again. You might mean the world to someone else.</li>
<li>When it hurts to look back, and you're scared to look ahead, you can look beside you and your best friend will be there</li>
<li>True friendship never ends.</li>
<li>Friends are forever.</li>
<li>Good friends are like stars....You don't always see them, but you know they are always there.</li>
<li>Don't frown. You never know who is falling in love with your smile.</li>
<li>What do you do when the only person who can make you stop crying is the person who made you cry?</li>
<li>NOBODY IS PERFECT UNTIL YOU FALL IN LOVE WITH THEM. (Isn't that the truth?)</li>
<li>Everything is okay in the end. If it's not okay, then it's not the end.</li>
