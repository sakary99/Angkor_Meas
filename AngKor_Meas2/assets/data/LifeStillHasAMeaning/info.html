<p>If there is a future there is time for mending<br />Time to see your troubles coming to an ending.</p>
<p>Life is never hopeless however great your sorrow<br />If you're looking forward to a new tomorrow.</p>
<p>If there is time for wishing then there is time for hoping<br />When through doubt and darkness you are blindly groping.</p>
<p>Though the heart be heavy and hurt you may be feeling<br />If there is time for praying there is time for healing.</p>
<p>So if through your window there is a new day breaking<br />Thank God for the promise, though mind and soul be aching,</p>
<p>If with harvest over there is grain enough for gleaning<br />There is a new tomorrow and life still has meaning.</p>
